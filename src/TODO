TODO
  [ ] add an option to remove loopback IPs from the session IP address: ASH_CFG_SKIP_LOOPBACKS='true'
  [ ] add an option to remove ipv4 or ipv6 addresses: ASH_CFG_HOST_IP_TYPES='v4,v6'
  [ ] add an option to ignore non-commands: ASH_CFG_IGNORE_NON_COMMANDS='true'  # this avoids keeping passwords and/or junk commands in your database.
  [ ] find a safe way to get the 'builtin type' details for a command (without re-executing it)
  [ ] add more logging throughout the code.
  [ ] design a shell history function that attempts to intercept builtin history calls and redirect to builtin history wherever necessary ???
  [ ] write a formatter that collapses repeated column values automatically
  [ ] add an option for a formatter that includes visible pipe separators between aligned columns
  [ ] include a row of dashes after the header line for aligned columns
  [ ] make LOG(ERROR) and above also go to stderr

  [ ] If ASH_CFG_HISTORY_DB is undefined, assume they don't know what the command / utility is - have a more inviting message.  If you are setting this up for the first time, please see http://sites.google.com/projects/advanced_shell_history/...
  [ ] add a default formatter (aligned)
