TODO
  [ ] add an option to remove loopback IPs from the session IP address: ASH_SKIP_LOOPBACKS='true'
  [ ] add an option to remove ipv4 or ipv6 addresses: ASH_HOST_IP_TYPES='v4,v6'
  [ ] make the date more useable by adding a date table and linking to the date table - or find a way to include stored procedures in the DB that generate the date easily.
  [ ] add an option to ignore non-commands: ASH_IGNORE_NON_COMMANDS='true'  # this avoids keeping passwords and/or junk commands in your database.
  [ ] add a way to determine the actual binary / alias / function that was invoked for each command
  [ ] add some kind of logging: ASH_LOG_FILE='/tmp/foo' and ASH_LOG_LEVEL='info'
  [ ] add an automatic way of detecting object file dependencies based on #includes and insert them into the Makefile.
