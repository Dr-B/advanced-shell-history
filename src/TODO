TODO
  [ ] add an option to remove loopback IPs from the session IP address: ASH_SKIP_LOOPBACKS='true'
  [ ] add an option to remove ipv4 or ipv6 addresses: ASH_HOST_IP_TYPES='v4,v6'
  [ ] add an option to ignore non-commands: ASH_IGNORE_NON_COMMANDS='true'  # this avoids keeping passwords and/or junk commands in your database.
  [ ] add a way to determine the actual binary / alias / function that was invoked for each command
  [ ] add more logging throughout the code.
  [ ] design a shell history function that attempts to intercept builtin history calls and redirect to builtin history wherever necessary ???
  [ ] add the 'type' output catching to the command logging and the DB schema.
  [ ] get rid of the need for ASH_SKIP, somehow - maybe use a command-scoped variable or only skip if a later-defined required variable is still unset...
  [ ] add a CFG level to CFG env vars, so all would start with ASH_CFG_ prefix.

database.cpp
  [ ] use sqlite3_sleep to sleep for milliseconds instead of the way i'm doing it now... USE THAT API!!!
  [ ] 

ash_query.cpp
  [ ] design a mechanism for adding more interactivity to the queries.  How can I get *directory* history or even *cwd* history?
  [ ] look for shell variables within the SQL.  maybe something like 'select * from commands where cwd = "${CWD}"'
  [ ] If ASH_HISTORY_DB is undefined, assume they don't know what the command is - have a more inviting message.  If you are setting this up for the first time, please see http://sites.google.com/projects/advanced_shell_history/...

BUGS
  [ ] pressing Enter at the command line causes a duplicate row to be recorded in the DB
