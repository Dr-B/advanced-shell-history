TODO
  [ ] add an option to remove loopback IPs from the session IP address: ASH_CFG_SKIP_LOOPBACKS='true'
  [ ] add an option to remove ipv4 or ipv6 addresses: ASH_CFG_HOST_IP_TYPES='v4,v6'
  [ ] add an option to ignore non-commands: ASH_CFG_IGNORE_NON_COMMANDS='true'  # this avoids keeping passwords and/or junk commands in your database.
  [ ] find a safe way to get the 'builtin type' details for a command (without re-executing it)
  [ ] add more logging throughout the code.
  [ ] design a shell history function that attempts to intercept builtin history calls and redirect to builtin history wherever necessary ???
  [ ] 

database.cpp
  [ ] 

ash_query.cpp
  [ ] design a mechanism for adding more interactivity to the queries.  How can I get *directory* history or even *cwd* history?
  [ ] look for shell variables within the SQL.  maybe something like 'select * from commands where cwd = "${CWD}"'
  [ ] If ASH_CFG_HISTORY_DB is undefined, assume they don't know what the command / utility is - have a more inviting message.  If you are setting this up for the first time, please see http://sites.google.com/projects/advanced_shell_history/...
