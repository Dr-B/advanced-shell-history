It may be worth your time to [HOWTO_Debug turn on more verbose debugging output] to help narrow down the issue.

====There is noticeable delay before each prompt is redrawn.====

This can be caused by a few things.
 * The cpu is overloaded or something else is wrong with the host.
 * Your DB file exists on an NFS mount and it can't be reached quickly.
 * Your connection to the remote host is flaky.

You can _immediately disable_ history logging by exporting an environment variable.
{{{
  $ export ASH_DISABLE='please'  # Any non-empty value will work, actually.
}}}
You can later undo the disable like this:
{{{
  $ unset ASH_DISABLE
}}}
If you see the problem immediately go away after disabling logging, it's likely that the database is the culprit.  Perhaps the file exists on an NFS mounted filesystem or maybe the filesystem is full.  It's possible that the DB is simply getting large and indexes should be created.  In that case, please [http://code.google.com/p/advanced-shell-history/issues/entry raise an issue with your specifics] (if they may be divulged).

If the problem does _*not*_ go away after disabling logging, it's likely a separate problem with the host or possibly your connection to it (are you connecting through ssh?).
