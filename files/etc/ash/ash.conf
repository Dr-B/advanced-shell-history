# This file is intended to be sourced!  All variables declared here will exist
# in the shell environment.  This is to prevent opening and parsing a config
# file once for every single command issued at the prompt.
#
#
# All declared variables MUST be named with a common prefix of ASH_
#
# Also, all variables must conform to the form: ASH_FOO='value'.
# This means mandatory single-quoted values (no double-quotes).
#
#   Examples:
#     GOOD:
#       ASH_LOG_FILE='/tmp/ash.log'
#       ASH_DB_FAIL_TIMEOUT='20'
#     BAD:
#       ASH_LOG_FILE=/tmp/ash_log            # Error: missing quotes
#       ASH_PRECMD="$( eject && eject -t )"  # Error: double-quotes
#       LOG_FILE='/tmp/ash.log'              # Error: missing ASH_ prefix.
#

# ASH_DB_MAX_RETRIES - Determines how many times an insert will be retried 
#                      before the insert fails.
ASH_DB_MAX_RETRIES='5'  # Default: 5

# ASH_DB_FAIL_TIMEOUT - Sleep this many ms between failed insert attempts.
ASH_DB_FAIL_TIMEOUT='3'  # Default: 3

# ASH_DB_FAIL_RANDOM_TIMEOUT - Sleep up to this many additional random ms
#                              between failed insert attempts.
ASH_DB_FAIL_RANDOM_TIMEOUT='4'  # Default: 4
