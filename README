This is the official readme for the Advanced Shell History project.

This project aims to provide a convenient and lightweight mechanism to add
detailed interactive console command history.

Some initial goals:
  1. Clearly separate history between terminal sessions.
  2. Save extra command data such as exit code, pipestatus and runtime.
  3. Impose low overhead and require no additional libraries.
  4. Work well with multiple popular shells.
